# Space XY

## Space shooter 2D game

This is a very simple 2D game based on Cocos2D.

See the [video on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FRIrsMbjr4)

I wrote most of the code in 2 days so there is still a lot of margin for improvements :)



### Controls

Touchscreen:
* Touch on the left side of the screen: shoot
* Touch on the right side of the screen: ship engine

Keyboard:
* Space bar: shoot
* Any other key: ship engine


### What's next

A few things I'd like to add in the future:

* Better collision system
* An *amazing* sound track
* Keep track of the best scores
